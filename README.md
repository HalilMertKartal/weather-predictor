# weather-predictor
This is a kind of a weather predictor app as cloudy, rainy, shine and sunrise, which uses a pre-trained Keras base model. The base model was modified by adding layers. Jupyter app needs some files to run: Training data, saved models and images to test. But those are nearly add up to 1 GB in total, so they were not uploaded here.

https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/4drtyfjtfy/1 -> is the link for the images that used as training data.

New images can be added into the "predict_images" folder to further testing.
